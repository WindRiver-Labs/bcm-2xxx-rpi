The RPi binary firmware can boot U-Boot just like it can boot a downstream kernel.
As such, you can simply copy u-boot.bin to the boot partition of the SD card.

This directory contains the prebuild u-boot-pri-3-32b.bin for RPI 3 target board
and u-boot-pri-2.bin for RPI 2 target board, which were built from the
opensource git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git master branch. More detailed information
about how to get and compile the source and boot the target board, please refer
to: http://elinux.org/RPi_U-Boot.

Assume here, the SD card has installed with Raspbian firmware, if not please
refer to:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md

Update u-boot:
==============
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/tmp
cp u-boot-pri-3-32b.bin /mnt/tmp/
echo 'kernel=u-boot-pri-3-32b.bin' >> /mnt/tmp/config.txt
echo 'enable_uart=1' >> /mnt/tmp/config.txt
umount /mnt/tmp

In the commands above, you may need to replace "/dev/sdb1" with a different
device filename, depending on where your SD card reader shows up. cat
/proc/partitions should help you locate the correct device filename.
